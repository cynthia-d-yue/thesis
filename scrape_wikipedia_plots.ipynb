The two begin pursuing Birdy's hobby of catching pigeons and caging them in a large, wooden aviary that he has built outside his parents' home. One night, they climb atop a refinery building, where Birdy hangs on the ledge to catch the pigeons roosting on it. Birdy loses his grip and falls several stories, but lands on a pile of sand. Slightly dazed, he tells Al that during the fall, he flew. After Birdy is hospitalized for minor injuries, his parents dismantle the aviary.\n",

As the film opens, Prospero is staying at the hotel, determined to solve the case. Helping him are his nephew, Inspector Neveau, and Neveau's girlfriend Arielle. Emile is at the hotel to settle a debt with Jim Fox Warner, a fight promoter. Emile's airline shuttle service is failing, as is his marriage to Francoise, who joins him at the hotel and ends up having an affair with Jim.

      "<p>Marguerite Muir is a dentist, single and middle-aged, independent and unpredictable of mood. Georges Palet is in his late 50s, married, and unemployed; he too is temperamental, and burdened by something in his past. When Georges discovers the discarded wallet from Marguerite's stolen handbag and hands it in to the police station, he allows himself to imagine the door opening to a romantic encounter. Marguerite initially has other ideas, but is later drawn towards Georges. Georges's wife Suzanne, Marguerite's best friend Josépha and two policemen are drawn into the entanglement of their lives. Georges and Marguerite share a passion for aviation, which leads to a flight with Suzanne in Marguerite's plane, while a farmer watches apprehensively from below. There is an uncertain resolution of their adventure, and the film ends with an enigmatic question from the farmer's daughter.\n",

Luciano's friends, who are ignorant and dishonest, decide to persuade Luciano to audition for a part as one of the boys in Big Brother.  Naively, Luciano is convinced and decides to go to Cinecittà in Rome to audition.  At the audition the committee finds Luciano pleasant, though insignificant, and the assistant director dismisses him, saying he will be contacted if selected for the program. However, when Luciano returns to his neighborhood in Naples, he begins going crazy while waiting to hear from the assistant director. He believes he is being watched by hidden cameras from the television program he loves so much and is really happy about them.  Luciano believes that appearing generous will win him the part on Big Brother, so he begins to give small gifts to the poor of the city, then spends large amounts of money giving away more expensive items, such as furniture, from his house. His wife and other relatives despair and believe that Luciano is out of his mind. His wife is especially worried and bursts into tears when she meets a friend of Luciano. She asks him why her husband has become so strange and, although he feels a deep sorrow for Luciano's tearful wife, he does not know how to answer. Luciano continues to get worse and is seen laughing for no reason.  Finally, he makes a pilgrimage to Rome, and becomes obsessed with studying for his part in Big Brother, which is now his only reason for living.\n",

Observing the behaviour of the wife at the funeral (she tries to pass on the responsibility of addressing the guests to Suzu) Sachi guesses that Suzu looked after their father as he died, not the wife. At the train station Sachi spontaneously invites Suzu to come and live with them. Later, Suzu moves in. She joins the local football team and becomes popular as the older sisters lives develop.\n",

In those days, the kingdom was ruled by the king with the unwieldy title of Charles V + III = VIII + VIII = XVI, the bird states he wasn't a very good king; a heartless tyrant that hated everyone and was hated in return.

He sends her to be a courtesan, but there, too, she fails and is again sent home. She goes to serve the family of a woman who must hide the fact that she is bald from her husband. The woman becomes jealous of Oharu and makes her chop off her hair, but Oharu retaliates, revealing the woman's secret. She again must leave—this time she marries a fan maker who is killed shortly after during a robbery. She attempts to become a nun, but Oharu is thrown out after being caught naked with a man seeking reimbursement for an unauthorized gift (it is made clear this is rape by Oharu's claims and distraught demeanor). She is thrown out of the temple, becomes a prostitute, but fails even at that. In the end, she is recalled to the Lord's house in order to keep secret her activities and to be exiled within the compounds to keep her secrets locked away. While being scolded for the life she chose, she attempts to find her son, and in the process, ends up running away as she chooses the life of a wandering nun over the life in exile.\n",

      "<p>Thérèse is living in a provincial town, unhappily married to Bernard, a dull, pompous man whose only interest is preserving his family name and property. They live in an isolated country mansion surrounded by servants. Early in her marriage, her only comforts are her fondness for Bernard's pine-tree forest, which was her primary reason for marrying him, and her love for her sister-in-law and Bernard's half-sister, Anne. On Thérèse's honeymoon, she slipped away from Bernard's bed to throw away a letter from Anne in which Anne expressed her love for Jean, a Jewish student. Later, when Jean leaves Anne, Thérèse feels a sense of satisfaction and relief. However, Anne soon leaves. Desperately lonely and trapped, Thérèse accidentally learns that an increase in Bernard's medication makes him ill. While Anne nurses Thérèse's unwanted baby, Thérèse begins to experiment, taking advantage of his hypochondria and forgetfulness. Eventually she tries to poison him with arsenic, but the dose isn't fatal. Thérèse's forged prescriptions are then discovered. Thérèse is arrested, but Bernard refuses to press charges. She is acquitted when Bernard perjures himself for her at the trial and her politically influential father bribes a court official. On the way back to the country estate, she tries to think of an explanation to offer to Bernard. Unable to give Bernard a proper explanation, she allows Bernard to place her in a prison of his own devising. He locks her in a bedroom and allows her only cigarettes and wine, as she slowly wastes away. Much later, he frees her for a party at which the family gathers to meet Anne's new husband, and their friends are shocked at her sickly appearance and deterioration. Bernard then moves her to Paris. Still hoping to learn the motives for her crime, he listens to further explanations, but he cannot understand. The movie recounts in flashback the circumstances that led to her being charged with poisoning her husband.\n",

When Tanya and Kovrin were children, Yegor became Kovrin's carer when both his parents died. Both think very highly of Kovrin and are very excited about his arrival. Kovrin learns how much work it is to take care of the garden, and develops a deep appreciation for it. Then he starts seeing a black monk, whose appearance borders on the supernatural, and begins to question his sanity. The black monk convinces Kovrin that he is chosen by God for a special purpose – that he has the power to save mankind from millennia of suffering using his genius, and that his recent ill health of late is inevitable for someone making such noble sacrifices.\n",

The film opens with the reedy voice of Emperor Hirohito announcing Japan's surrender as the eldest of the Lin clan's four sons awaits the birth of his child in a coastal town not far from Taipei. Soon afterward, he changes the name of his Japanese decorated bar to \"Little Shanghai\" and begins trading in the post-war black market. The second son has died in Philippines during the war. The third son, who had a nervous breakdown in Shanghai, starts to consort with Shanghaiese drug dealers upon his return to Taiwan. Once the eldest learns of the third's dealings, he forces him to stop. In retaliation, the Shanghaiese mob arranges for the third son to be imprisoned on trumped up charges of collaboration with the Japanese. The youngest son, Wen-ching, is a gentle deaf-mute photographer who has leftist leanings. The film climaxes with the notorious Incident of February 28, 1947, a massacre of native Taiwanese committed by Kuomintang troops resulting in between 18,000 to 28,000 casualties. The wounded pour into the neighbor clinic as Wen-ching and his friend Hinoe get arrested. After his release, Hinoe heads for the mountains to join the leftist guerillas while Wen-ching promises to look after his friend's sister Hinomi. Soon after, Wen-ching and Hinomi marry. Just as she is about to bear a child, however, the Kuomintang arrests Wen-ching for his involvement with the guerillas.\n",

      "<p>The Sciascia story unfolds with the arrival in Sicily of a medicine rep from Verona. He is unaware that he witnessed a double murder at a rural railway station until he hears about the event on his car radio. He calls on the local police station to help with the enquiries. The police have discovered the body of a retired ambassador, returned after years of absence, in his remote farmhouse, after he had called them about the discovery of an item (a stolen painting) rolled up in the attic. The police did not call that night, since the duty Inspector thought it might be a hoax (he knew the farm house to be abandoned). The following day the strange appearance of the retired ambassador's body, which appears to have been a suicide, raises suspicion that he may have been murdered. This is the investigating policeman's opinion but it is rejected by the Police Commissioner, who insists on a simple and uncomplicated suicide. There is a suggestion that the Carabinieri who have also turned up at the crime scene are aware of the alternative theory. Meanwhile, interrogation of the medicine rep from Verona clarifies that he had not seen the railway staff, but rather their murderers rolling up a \"carpet\" (actually the painting) in the station. The investigation proceeds with an old friend of the \"suicide,\" a professor Franzo who reveals more about the telephone conversations they had exchanged before the ambassador's death. It looks to the police as though the farm buildings had been used for criminal activity for some time. The inspector, however, appears to be overly familiar with the inside of the main house and real doubts enter the Brigadiere's mind as to his real involvement in the crime.  The judge insists unreasonably that the police Commissioner and Carabinieri should give him cast iron evidence if he is to proceed with any case, as in his view all he heard were conjectures. The estranged widow and son of the ambassador arrive and the extent of the family rift is evident. They appear to have relied on the local parish priest Don Cricco to oversee the mainly abandoned family properties in the area. The film ends with an accident in which the Inspector and Brigadiere exchange pistol shots, killing the Inspector. The police call it an accident.\n",

Zhanna (Yuliya Vysotskaya), a young woman, lives in the belief that the pop star Bryan Adams is her fiancé, that he is off on tour and will, at some point in the future, come to take her away with him. Zhanna is sort of the ad hoc keeper of peace, happiness and control of the others; she attempts to help curb some of the other patients exuberant impulses. Blissfully unaware of the terror of the war, the patients stick it out in the hospital. Their guests include a group of Chechen rebels, one of whom, Ahmed (Sultan Islamov), gives Zhanna the idea that he will marry her. At this point Zhanna falls in love with Ahmed.  She goes back to the \"House\" where, with the help of her fellow residents, she prepares for her marriage to Ahmed. From this point on Zhanna prepares for and expects to be swept away by Ahmed. Her hopes do not come to fruition and Ahmed and Zhanna part ways.  Zhanna returns to the \"House\" in order to resume her life there.\n",

      "<p>The film starts by showing how life, as a blacksmith, was in the city of <a href=\"/wiki/Mardin\" title=\"Mardin\">Mardin</a>, where Nazareth and his family used to live. Although Nazareth had his suspicions about possible effects of the World War I, and he was considering the possibility of non-Muslim minorities of the Ottoman Empire being conscripted to fight in the army, his family and friends were trying to be optimistic, although they heard stories of disappearing men from different villages. One night, Ottoman soldiers came to his door and took him to work for the army at a road construction, which is basically in the middle of an uninhabited area. While he was working there and as time passed by, he and his friends started to notice different groups of passer-by Armenians, under arrest. They even witnessed a rape. At one point, an Ottoman officer came to their camp and asked them if they would accept to convert to Islam. Some did and some did not. The officer and his fellows took the converts and left. Some soldiers and convicts, recruited solely to kill Armenians, arrived the next day to kill the rest. The convict responsible for cutting the throat of Nazareth could not go all the way with it and made only a small cut on his throat, which sufficed to cause Nazareth to faint, thereby survive the massacre. However, while saving his life, the cut also made him mute. This \"cut\" not only symbolizes Nazareth's becoming mute but also his being cut from his life and family and the Armenian society's silence about the Genocide at the time.\n",

Adrien goes to the home of Frantz's parents, Dr. Hans and Magda Hoffmeister, and tries to speak to Hans, but when Hans hears that Adrien is French, he tells Adrien that a Frenchman killed his son and, calling the French murderers, drives Adrien away. Adrien tells Hans, \"You are right. I am a murderer\". Meanwhile, Anna is rejecting the unwelcome advances of an older suitor, particularly as she cannot forget Frantz. Anna sees Adrien at the grave and sends him a invitation him to the Hoffmeister home. After she tells the Hoffmeisters that Adrien was leaving flowers at Frantz's grave, they relent. Adrien visits and, upon questioning, recounts falsely that he and Frantz were students together in Paris before the war.

Anna takes Adrien to the places she and Frantz used to go together, including the mountaintop where he proposed to her.

The Hoffmeisters ask Adrien, who had been a violinist, but whose hearing was damaged in the war, to play Frantz's violin for them, as Frantz used to do. Adrien asks Anna to go to the local ball with him and she accepts.\n",

The kitchen is located in the Italian part of the hotel, so Giuseppe argues that Ferdinand is actually Italian and is thus not entitled to act as a French customs officer, making his arrest unlawful. At a subsequent audit with the municipal authorities of Assola, Ferdinand discovers that the man who recorded his birth, Gaspar Donnadiè, owner of the Two Borders, failed to register him in the right place: the Italian municipality. The same Donadiè tells Ferdinand that he went to the French Townhall because it was raining that day and it was a shorter walk than going to the Italian one.\n",

One day, while attending a fashion show mounted by her friend Madeleine (<a href=\"/wiki/Micheline_Presle\" title=\"Micheline Presle\">Micheline Presle</a>), a couturière, Claire meets a lighthearted young Frenchman, Antoine (<a href=\"/wiki/Jean-Pierre_Cassel\" title=\"Jean-Pierre Cassel\">Jean-Pierre Cassel</a>). Despite the fact that he is being kept by Madeleine, Claire responds to his advances and returns with him to his luxurious bachelor apartment. Before long she is visiting him five afternoons a week; evenings and weekends are reserved for Georges and the children. Madeleine, strong-willed and possessive, learns of the affair and decides to meet the situation directly by inviting Claire and Georges, as well as Antoine, to the same party. The desired effect is achieved when it becomes apparent that Claire is tiring of Antoine and has no intention of seeing him again. Only Georges, quiet and gentle, understands that nothing has really changed. It will not be long before Claire will once more embark on her quest for chance lovers.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-tcm_2-0\"><a href=\"#cite_note-tcm-2\">[2]</a></sup>\n",

His conspirators turn against him and cause his local party to attempt to deselect him. He narrowly escapes a vote of no-confidence in his constituency, and goes in search of Pauline who has ended their relationship, still in love, but knowing it is not the right relationship for her. He goes back home, to find his wife who wants to try again, and she gives him her phone number. The Prime Minister offers him a post, and reveals that the reason Johnnie was not offered one before was due to his wife's communist connections.

Luis is a weak, forlorn individual, an alcoholic addicted to wine, women and science fiction rather than social conviviality or male camaraderie.

Aged 76, she is dependent on <a href=\"/wiki/National_Assistance\" title=\"National Assistance\">National Assistance</a> from the British government. She is visited by her criminal son, who hides a package containing a large sum of money, in her unused spare room. The son confesses to the police of his robbery, then is sent to jail. Meanwhile, Mrs. Ross finds the money. Thinking the money is a windfall intended for her, Mrs. Ross makes elaborate plans. She casually confides to a stranger, who befriends her in order to  ply her with spirits, kidnap her, then rob her of the stolen money. Rendered drunk and abandoned to the elements by her captors, Mrs. Ross contracts pneumonia. She is found by  neighbors, then after almost dying, recovers in a hospital. It's the first time anyone has cared for her in years. Doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, and social workers all focus on her case. An agent at the National Assistance bureau traces down her  husband, Archie (who deserted her decades ago). Motivated by the agent, who threatens him with legal pressure, informing him of his legal responsibility to her, the husband is strongly encouraged to move back in with her, which he does. Soon, he becomes involved with gamblers, then steals their money at a chance opportunity, which forces him to flee, so he deserts her again. Having been on the verge of a return to functional living, Mrs. Ross resumes her lonely status as an isolated person, who talks to the walls. This movie depicts these events as occurring during the year 1966, the year that British National Assistance was replaced by <a href=\"/wiki/Supplementary_Benefit\" title=\"Supplementary Benefit\">Supplementary Benefit</a>.\n",

The hero is killed, but then he gets up and goes to a nearby town and presents himself to the audience as Boris Varissa, a comrade of the local resistance leader, presumably the murdered Jan Rabenau. In the tavern he tells the story about him rescuing the wounded Rabenau but it appears that no one believes him. After that he goes to a decrepit ancestral castle of Rabenau where he meets three beauties – wife of Rabenau, his sister and the maid. His new story of saving Rabenau does not convince the women either. However, Boris manages to gain a foothold in the castle, and even to have affairs with the women, although there are challenging sexual relationships between them. As the film progresses it is possible to assume that Boris is not a resistance fighter but instead a traitor, or that he is just an adventurer, or a madman. There are also doubts as to whether such a man really existed, and if there was, whether he was alive (at some point in the local cemetery a grave is shown with a Boris Varissa marker), and if alive, whether he is really Boris. Maybe it's just the spirit of the deceased Boris, and maybe he is actually Jan (at one point he claims this).\n",

He loses his work permit when he is caught urinating in public, so he begins to lead a clandestine life in Switzerland. At first he is supported by Elena, a <a href=\"/wiki/Greeks\" title=\"Greeks\">Greek</a> woman and political refugee. Then he befriends an Italian industrialist, relocated to Switzerland because of financial problems. The industrialist takes him under his wing, only to commit suicide when he squanders his last savings. Nino is constrained to find shelter with a group of clandestine Neapolitans living in a chicken coop, together with the same chickens they tend to in order to survive. Charmed by the idyllic vision of a group of young blonde Swisses, having a bath in a river, he decides to dye his hair and pass himself off as a local. In a bar, when rooting for the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Italian_national_football_team\" title=\"Italian national football team\">Italian national football team</a> during the broadcast of a match, he is found out after <a href=\"/wiki/Goal_celebration\" title=\"Goal celebration\">celebrating a goal</a> scored by <a href=\"/wiki/Fabio_Capello\" title=\"Fabio Capello\">Fabio Capello</a>. He is arrested and brought at a station. He meets Elena again, who wants to give him a renewed permit but he refuses. He embarks on a train and finds himself in a cabin filled with returning Italian guest workers. Amid the songs of \"sun\" and \"sea\", he is seen having second thoughts. He gets off at the first stop: better life as an illegal immigrant than a life of misery.\n",

      "<p>A middle-aged penniless drunkard arrives at a sleepy village in a bus. At the bus-stand people are talking something about some \"Maruti Kamble\" in a hushed tone. The news of his arrival reaches the sugar baron Mr. Hindurao Dhonde-Patil through his henchman who expresses his doubt that the drunkard may be a sleuth sent by the central government. Hindurao is worried. Hindurao invites the drunkard to his mansion and provides him space to live in order to keep an eye on him. He asks the drunkard some direct questions like who he is and where he comes from. But the drunkard dodges his questions by giving some philosophical or imbecile answers. He does not even reveal his name. Hindurao decides to call him \"Master\" (teacher). Hindurao tells Master how backward this village was and how Hindurao worked hard for the progress of the village. Now there is a sugar factory, poultry, school etc. for the village. Master observes that the progress is not of the village but only of Hindurao. Master is perpetually drunk and again overhears people asking \"what became of “Maruti Kamble\". He asks people about Maruti Kamble but they suddenly become silent. When Hindurao comes to know that Master is enquiring about Maruti Kamble, he becomes worried. Finally he calls him and makes a pact with him. The pact is that Hindurao would tell Master everything about Maruti Kamble and Master will stop his enquiries and leave the village. Hindurao says that Maruti Kamble was a military man and posed a challenge to Mr Hindurao's economic and political progress, so Hindurao falsely implicated him in a crime. He alleged that Maruti Kamble had extra marital affair with a widow. The villagers could not tolerate such immoral behaviour. Maruti Kamble thought that people would believe the charges to be true and try to kill him, so he tried to run away. Before police could get him, Hindurao got Maruti Kamble murdered and people thought that Maruti Kamble had run away to escape villagers' wrath, though some people had their \"doubts\". As Hindurao had told the truth about Maruti Kamble, it is Master's turn to leave the village. But Master is a man of conscience. Master had fought in the independence struggle of India and is pained to see that though people had become free of the British rule, they are again being exploited by persons like Hindurao. Now should he fight against the tyranny of Hindurao too? Master leaves the village. Outside the village, at the district headquarters, people notice that Master has made a demand to the government that an enquiry be made into the misdeeds of Maruti Kamble and that Maruti Kamble be found and brought to justice. Master has also decided to fast until his demand is met and he is ready to fast until death. Hindurao anticipates the results and contacts district administrator and politicians, but they show no inclination to help him out. Hindurao tries to give a speech in order to divert the attention of people from the topic of Maruti Kamble but people ask \"What became of Maruti Kamble ?\" and shout him down. Hindurao runs away to Mumbai and in his absence chaos spreads in the management of his factory and poultry. Other politicians are eager to fill in this vacuum. Master reaches Hindurao's hideout and persuades him to face the reality and surrender in order to give himself a chance. Finally Hindurao surrenders to the police. As police handcuff Hindurao in front of villagers and lead him to the police vehicle, Hindurao turns to Master and gives only a smile without malice. There ends the confrontation (Saamana) between a penniless drunkard and a potentate.\n",

The main characters are Patrick Desmouceaux, who is motherless and just starts getting interested in women such as his young teacher, and his friend Julien Leclou, who lives in poverty and is physically abused at home. Julien cannot stay awake at school after a night without sleep, and refuses to undress in order to hide his bruises. The film mixes the story of these characters with other more or less innocent childhood experiences and challenges of a number of children. Scenes include life at school, a toddler and a cat perilously playing on an open windowsill but falling down unhurt, a girl causing confusion with a <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Bullhorn\" title=\"Bullhorn\">bullhorn</a> in an apartment window, Bruno showing his friends how to chat up girls, a double date at a movie theater, a child telling a dirty joke, a botched haircut, first love and first kisses. In the end Julien's abuse becomes public and he is taken away from his family. The story ends with the message of one of the teachers about child abuse, injustice, children's rights, hope, love and resilience: \"Of all mankind's injustices, injustice to children is the most despicable! Live isn't always fair, but we can fight for justice. [...] If kids had the right to vote, they would have better schools [...] Life isn't easy. You must steel yourselves to face it. I don't mean \"hard-boiled\". I am talking about endurance and resilience. [...] Time flies. Before long, you will have children of your own. If you love them, they will love you. If they don't feel you love them, they will transfer their love and tenderness to other people. Or to things. That's life! Each of us needs to be loved!\"<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-5\"><a href=\"#cite_note-5\">[5]</a></sup>\n",

The film documents the convivial life among the film crew and the hazards, problems and tension of film making on location. The actors live a double life, and the villagers, both simple and not-so-simple, flock to watch their work with wonder and suspicion. But as the film progresses, the recreated past begins to confront the present. The uneasy coexistence of 1943 and 1980 reveals bizarre connection, involving a village woman whose visions add a further dimension of time—that of future.

The Marquis Onofrio del Grillo is one of his favorites, but even the worst of all the nobility. As a privileged and protected nobleman, Onofrio feels free to play his pranks on the poor people without any fear of the consequences. On one occasion, when he is arrested at a dinner with common criminals, he turns to the populace in a vulgar speech, claiming that his nobility allows him to do what he wants, and that they, being poor, are not worth anything. Memorable is the dispute between the poor Jew Aronne Piperno and the Marquis for the payment of a salary. Aaron is amazed when Onofrio refuses to pay with the argument that his creditor being a Jew is a murderer of <a href=\"/wiki/Jesus\" title=\"Jesus\">Jesus</a>. Aaron brings his case to court, but Onofrio wins the lawsuit by corrupting the judges and the cardinals. Piperno is condemned and mocked by the people, and Onofrio announces to the Pope that justice has just died in his States.\n",

To maintain it Louis works overtime, accepts Bertrand's invitations to nightclubs and dinners with an androgynous woman, and places his house at Bertrand's disposal. Nina sees through her husband's behaviour and objects, but Louis cannot refuse Bertrand's demands, and she is unable to make him see how much his personality has changed.

Marika was deported to Greece along with all the other Greeks in Smyrna when she was seven years old, and a few years later, her parents started a career as a musician and a singer in a nightclub/bar. In the short space of one decade, Marika witnesses her father murder her mother, runs away from home, has a baby, and comes back to the nightclub to sing in an act with a childhood friend, Yorgos and a <a href=\"/wiki/Bouzouki\" title=\"Bouzouki\">bouzouki</a> player, Babis. Success finally comes at the expense of the suicide of another female singer at the club (named Rosa), but then Yorgos is exiled for political reasons, and she and Babis leave for other venues. Although Marika carries a torch for Babis, their relationship never seems to work out, and after many years and World War II go by, she sends her daughter away to a convent school (to later become a dancer in a cabaret, much to Marika's chagrin) and goes on a tour in America.  She then returns to Greece to find herself supplanted by a younger singer named Matina who has caught the attention of Babis.  Near the end of the movie, she is stabbed in the stomach the night of her reunion concert.

Lucja's neighbor Wiktor who is a Communist intellectual, tries to help the poverty-stricken Lucja and her children, but is arrested and imprisoned by Poland's pre-war right-wing regime. Then come the dark years of the German occupation. At the black market, Lucja narrowly avoids a Nazi roundup. Lucja sons turn to Communism and hold ardent meetings in their apartment, with their mother's blessing. Lucja goes on working hard, and without complaining. After the war, the Communists take power in Poland - but rather than being rewarded for his loyal service, the son Klemens is inexplicably arrested, and without any foundation the new regime accuses him of having been a collaborator. His brother Wiktor, who now holds a senior position in the Communist Party, tries to defend him - but then himself falls into disgrace. Klemens undergoes torture in order to extract a false \"confession\" but dies in prison, a Communist to the end. His mother Lucja is never told about what happened to him.\n",

Ignoring her overbearing husband, Ray (<a href=\"/wiki/Brian_Kerwin\" title=\"Brian Kerwin\">Brian Kerwin</a>), she travels by bus to attend the <a href=\"/wiki/State_funeral_of_John_F._Kennedy\" title=\"State funeral of John F.

After the bus has an accident, Lurene notices wounds on Jonell's body. Lurene senses something is wrong, suspects Paul and calls the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/FBI\" title=\"FBI\">FBI</a> to report that there has been a kidnapping. Moments after her well-intentioned interference, Paul explains that Jonell's wounds are from an orphanage that he rescued her from and he is indeed her real father. Nevertheless, Lurene's FBI call leads the three of them on an increasingly difficult road trip across America with both the police and Ray in pursuit.<sup class=\"reference\" id=\"cite_ref-3\"><a href=\"#cite_note-3\">[3]</a></sup> Over the course of the film Lurene and Paul develop a deep relationship, leading to a one-night sexual encounter.

However, Leland's interest is piqued when he hears about corporate secrets being leaked, and he hires his son, Patrick, a soldier with covert military expertise, to manage security. From Patrick, Leland gets the idea of building war toys in the factory, even though Leslie points out Zevo Toys has never made war toys due to Kenneth's dislike of war in general.

While revealing why and how the conflicts come about, the story depicts every corner of real life—romantic, shamanic, and Confucian aspects of the contemporaries. It provides a further insight into the politically controversial ideological issue on which the viewpoint is virtually hardened among over 40's in South Korea. This ideological issue survives even in the digital age to have a substantial effect on presidential elections. The author dares to show what the ideological conflict derives from and tries to describe it in detail and with artistic skill of commanding Korean colloquial language supplying its readers the true taste of Korean dialect expressions especially in its southern part Jeolla province.\n",

Crashing through a police road block, the driver, Grand is crushed by the steering column. Back at their hideout, a small disused caravan near a beach, they are discovered by the police. Cold, Lebanese and Dandi run away, but are captured. Grand, who is mortally wounded, dies in the caravan. Roll opening credits. Some years later, in the 1970s, Ice is released from prison and joins up with Lebanese, who tells him he has come up with a plan to kidnap and hold to ransom Baron Rossellini, a wealthy aristocrat for whom Lebanese's parents worked. He has formed a gang with Dandi - they are Black, Bright Eye, Ricotta, Bufalo, Rat and Ciro and Aldo Buffoni. After negotiating the ransom of 3 billion lire, the Baron is shot by one of the Cannizzari brothers who have been entrusted by Lebanese to guard him. Nonetheless, they take a picture of the dead man with a newspaper and get the 3 billion lire. However, the local Police Commissioner Nicola Scialoja manages to record the serial numbers of the ransom money before the gang receives it, setting out to capture the gang. As the gang divide up the money, Lebanese proposes to split 500 million lire between them, and use the remaining 2.5 billion to build a foothold in the criminal underworld of Rome, starting with drug dealing. However, the drugs racket is owned by the dealer Terrible, and so the gang wipe his gang out apart from Gemito, who Lebanese bribes to help them. After his home is raided and his body guards killed, Terrible wakes to find Ice, Lebanese and Dandi in his bedroom. Cornered, he reluctantly agrees to let give control of the racket to the gang. \n",

On the way back to Aida's home after the recital, Fausta comments about the positive reception that the song received. Aída is afraid Fausta will say something that will let the driver know Aida is not the composer and responds by kicking Fausta out into the dark streets of Lima by herself. \n",

After several minutes of small talk, the woman (<a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Im_Soo-jung_(actress)\" title=\"Im Soo-jung (actress)\">Im Soo-jung</a>) tells the man (<a href=\"/wiki/Hyun_Bin\" title=\"Hyun Bin\">Hyun Bin</a>) that she's leaving him for another man. The rest of the film takes place in the couple's home during a rainstorm on their last day together, as the husband helps his wife pack. Various quiet, introspective scenes show them doing things such as making coffee, smoking a cigarette, and reminiscing over nostalgic items. While eating together, the woman asks the man why he isn't angry with her, saying that he has a right to be. The man says that he knows she doesn't change her mind when she decides on something and feels that he is partially to blame for their rift. She then accuses the man of being selfish for acting as \"the perfect man\" during their breakup. Their conversation is interrupted by the meowing of a lost kitten outside. They bring it inside, but it escapes and hides elsewhere in the house. Soon, their neighbors come looking for the kitten and are invited inside. Strained conversation ensues, and the neighbors inform the couple that the rain has flooded the roads, preventing travel to Seoul. The husband answers a phone call from his wife's new lover and passes it to her. She tells him she'll have to put off leaving until the next day due to the flooding. He asks her, \"Is there anything holding you back?\" To which she doesn't answer. The neighbors leave without the kitten, telling the couple to call them when it comes out. Now unable to go to their planned dinner reservation, the couple prepares dinner together. The man begins sniffling while cutting onions, and goes to the bathroom to wash his eyes, silently standing while letting the faucet run. The film ends with the kitten coming out of hiding and the woman telling it that everything is going to be okay.\n",

His thoughts go back to the events that led to his capture.

Afterward, while in his hideout, Michael is surprised by German soldiers. He shoots his way out and is able to slip free. On a country road, a car driven by a German Field Officer (Arne Hershold) stops. Michael overpowers the officer and shoots him. Dressed in the officer's uniform, Michael is able to reach <a href=\"/wiki/Copenhagen\" title=\"Copenhagen\">Copenhagen</a> and find his girlfriend Ruth (Lisbeth Movin) at the hotel where she lives. Toto (Lau Lauritzen), the leader of the resistance group, is waiting for him. They are planning to sabotage a weapons <a href=\"/wiki/Factory\" title=\"Factory\">factory</a>. However, there is suspicion that there is an <a href=\"/wiki/Informant\" title=\"Informant\">informant</a> in the group, so the plan is delayed. One of the group's members, Dreyer (Freddy Koch), is arrested, so Ruth and Michael flee to her uncle's summer house. Ruth is frightened of losing Michael.

But it is revealed that there has been an informant, when the group is surprised by soldiers lying in wait for them. During the firefight, Michael is wounded. However, he is able to blow up the factory before he is captured. Back in the Gestapo jail, the prison guard Steinz (Per Buckhøj) who hates the war and the Nazis, tries to help Michael in small ways, but is unable to prevent his <a href=\"/wiki/Torture\" title=\"Torture\">torture</a>.

There is no other way but to kill him and it is not difficult to find members who will do it. While being driven to his execution, Steinz tells Michael that he has received a message—Steinz's entire family was killed during an Allied aerial bombardment that week. Michael asks Steinz to escape with him. Steinz declines and shoots himself in the car. Michael flees and seeks refuge in a <a href=\"/wiki/Bakery\" title=\"Bakery\">bakery</a> where he is able to contact Toto.

His family decides to have him ruled incompetent, and he is brought before a three-man tribunal, including Dr. Harada (Takashi Shimura), a Domestic Court counselor, for arbitration. Harada, a civil volunteer in the case, sympathizes with Nakajima's conviction. He points out that the fear of atomic and nuclear weapons is present in every citizen of Japan, and wonders aloud whether it is wrong to rule someone incompetent simply for being more worried than the average citizen. Eventually, the old man's irrational behavior prevents the court from taking his fears seriously, and he is found incompetent. Nakajima grows more and more obsessed with the idea of escaping Japan, eventually resulting in a tragic decision, once he is convinced it is the only way to save his loved ones.

When Sissi's first child is born, the Archduchess Sophie insists on taking away the child to raise her, because she feels Sissi is too young and unqualified to do so. Sophie also feels that Sissi's place is not in the nursery with her baby, but with her husband as the emperor travels around the empire. A scandal threatens to break out when Sissi leaves Vienna and returns to Bavaria to see her parents.  She keeps the truth from her mother, but confesses to her father that she cannot live with Archduchess Sophie's constant criticism and tyranny.  Franz Joseph follows her and finally convinces her to return to Vienna. This strengthens Sissi's influence with the emperor, and she supports Count <a href=\"/wiki/Gyula_Andr%C3%A1ssy\" title=\"Gyula Andrássy\">Gyula Andrássy</a> and the cause of the Hungarians for <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Ausgleich\" title=\"Ausgleich\">equal standing</a> in the Empire.

(In fact the coronation was not held until 1867, but \"Sissi--The Young Empress\" brings the event forward in time to make the ceremony appear to be a confirmation of Sissi's improving status as empress.)\n",

      "<p>The <a href=\"/wiki/Empress_Elisabeth_of_Austria\" title=\"Empress Elisabeth of Austria\">Austrian empress Elisabeth</a>, nicknamed Sissi, enjoys travelling in <a href=\"/wiki/Hungary\" title=\"Hungary\">Hungary</a>. She welcomes the politically valuable friendship of <a href=\"/wiki/Gyula_Andr%C3%A1ssy\" title=\"Gyula Andrássy\">Count Andrássy</a>, but when he confesses he is in love with her, she returns to Vienna lest the relationship become too intimate. Her time in Hungary is only a temporary relief from the frustrations of court life in <a href=\"/wiki/Vienna\" title=\"Vienna\">Vienna</a>, where dutiful <a href=\"/wiki/Franz_Joseph_I_of_Austria\" title=\"Franz Joseph I of Austria\">Franz Josef</a> remains at his desk and allows his strict, domineering mother <a href=\"/wiki/Princess_Sophie_of_Bavaria\" title=\"Princess Sophie of Bavaria\">Sophie</a> to interfere in the raising of his daughter with Sissi, <a href=\"/wiki/Archduchess_Sophie_of_Austria\" title=\"Archduchess Sophie of Austria\">Sophie</a>. Sissi decides to return and meets Franz underway who was coming to Hungary to bring her back to Vienna. They decide to take a vacation in <a href=\"/wiki/Bad_Ischl\" title=\"Bad Ischl\">Bad Ischl</a> but Sissi falls ill and is diagnosed with possibly fatal <a href=\"/wiki/Tuberculosis\" title=\"Tuberculosis\">tuberculosis</a>. On doctors' orders Franz Josef must allow his mother to remove his daughter from Sissi's keeping. In poor health, deprived of the company of husband and child, Sissi is in danger of losing the will to live as she travels to healthier climates on <a href=\"/wiki/Madeira\" title=\"Madeira\">Madeira</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Corfu\" title=\"Corfu\">Corfu</a>. Desperately needed <a href=\"/wiki/Psychosomatic_medicine\" title=\"Psychosomatic medicine\">psychosomatic</a> therapy appears in the form of her indestructibly positive mother <a href=\"/wiki/Princess_Ludovika_of_Bavaria\" title=\"Princess Ludovika of Bavaria\">Ludovika</a>, who lovingly nurses Sissi's illness and restores her zest for life by taking her on idyllic walks. Once again Oberst Böckl, the clumsy body-guard whose doting admiration for the empress borders on the improper, provides a comical note, as he does in each part of the trilogy. Finally, Sissi recovers and rejoins her husband on an official visit to <a href=\"/wiki/Milan\" title=\"Milan\">Milan</a> and <a href=\"/wiki/Venice\" title=\"Venice\">Venice</a>, Austria's remaining possessions in northern Italy. Nationalists have prepared a hostile welcome for the <a href=\"/wiki/House_of_Habsburg\" title=\"House of Habsburg\">Habsburg</a> sovereigns; the Milanese nobility send their servants, dressed in noble clothing, to a <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_Command_Performance\" title=\"Royal Command Performance\">royal command performance</a> at <a href=\"/wiki/La_Scala\" title=\"La Scala\">La Scala</a>, at which the orchestra begins with the melody of <a href=\"/wiki/Joseph_Haydn\" title=\"Joseph Haydn\">Joseph Haydn</a>'s <a href=\"/wiki/Gott_erhalte_Franz_den_Kaiser\" title=\"Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser\">Gott erhalte Franz den Kaiser</a> but smoothly transitions to Verdi's chorus \"<a href=\"/wiki/Va,_pensiero\" title=\"Va, pensiero\">Va, pensiero</a>\" from <i><a href=\"/wiki/Nabucco\" title=\"Nabucco\">Nabucco</a></i> and the disguised servants in the audience sing it in protest against Austrian rule. There is a moment of comic relief when, after the opera, Franz Josef and Sissi receive the disguised servants at a formal reception, where the servants are presented to the imperial couple under the names of their aristocratic masters and mistresses.  Sissi is aware that she is not meeting the true nobility, but when the real nobles realize their servants were introduced to the emperor and empress, they shriek in despair and panic at the idea that the imperial couple believe the awkward, common servants were really the aristocrats.  In Venice, crowds stand in hostile silence at the couple's <a href=\"/wiki/Procession\" title=\"Procession\">procession</a> by <a href=\"/wiki/Royal_barge\" title=\"Royal barge\">royal barge</a> on the <a href=\"/wiki/Grand_Canal_(Venice)\" title=\"Grand Canal (Venice)\">Grand Canal</a> and as they pass, Italian nationalist flags are defiantly unfurled from behind shuttered windows. But the emotional Italians melt when they witness the openly loving reunion between Sissi and her little daughter on <a href=\"/wiki/Piazza_San_Marco\" title=\"Piazza San Marco\">St Mark's Square</a>.\n",

The owners are in league with the bandits, who this very night plan to abduct Franziska, the Comtesse von Sandau, who is travelling through the forest with a group including her fiancé, Baron Sperling. Their coach is waylaid by a trap and the bandits direct them to the nearby inn. The waitress warns the journeymen of impending danger and they pass on the warning to the nobles. During the night, the brigands arrive. To escape, the Comtesse switches places with Felix and, in a man's clothes, escapes with Peter. Felix (as Comtesse), Franziska's maid and the pastor are taken to the bandits' lair. The bandits send Baron Sperling on his way to carry the demand for 20,000 Gulden to Graf Sandau, Franziska's father.\n",

He is primarily concerned with a young thief, Billy Lee Jackson, recently released from the Missouri State Penitentiary. Father Clark helps clear the boy of some trumped-up charges and then gets him an honest job with a produce market. Billy's rehabilitation is further encouraged by Ellen Henley, a young socialite with whom he falls in love. Meanwhile, aided by Louis Rosen, a successful criminal lawyer, Father Clark raises enough funds to open Halfway House, a shelter for ex-convicts readjusting to civilian life. All goes well until Billy's employer fires him for a theft he did not commit. Embittered, he and a friend, Pio, attempt to rob the produce market. They are caught by one of the owners, and he attacks Billy with a crowbar. The panic-stricken boy grabs a gun and kills him. The police chase Billy to an abandoned house, and he hides there until Father Clark persuades him to surrender. Tried and convicted of murder, he is sentenced to death. Before Billy dies in the gas chamber, Father Clark reassures him by telling him of <a href=\"/wiki/Penitent_thief\" title=\"Penitent thief\">Dismas</a>, the thief who died on the cross, and of how Christ promised him eternal life.

Tóno accepts and lets Mrs. Lautmannová believe he is her nephew who has come to help in the store. Their relationship grows until the authorities round up the town's entire Jewish population for transport, and Tóno finds himself conflicted as to whether he should turn in the senile Mrs. Lautmannová or hide her.

      "<p>A qualified surgeon is urgently called by a party in a small and inadequate private hospital to operate a man in critical condition because of a suicide attempt. This is the protagonist of the film, Benedict Parisi, whose first name seems prophetic of his story. In the waiting room is the companion Joan Micheli, pregnant with him, which—Benedict being alone in the world—gives consent to the risky operation. Her mother, Immaculate, however, hovers in the wings like a vulture, hoping he will die, because she aspires to marry Giovanna off to a lawyer friend of the family, as a better social and economic proposition.\n",
      "The narrative is interwoven with flashbacks to the early life of Benedict. He is an orphan, a lively lad growing up in village in the <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Latin_Valley\" title=\"Latin Valley\">Latin Valley</a>, under the tutelage of a maiden aunt who is filled with religious scruples, though given to libertine assignations, with which she indoctrinates him. The child is sleepless at night, because of noises from his aunt's room, which is visited by local men: his aunt instead tells him that the noises are a matter of remorse for his bad habits, and he is overcome by guilty feelings resulting from his repressive environment. When the day of his first communion nears, for which he prepares with accentuated religious devotion, he, with the other communicants, is given an effigy of \"celestial friends,\" saints who are expected to assist them until they embrace Jesus.  Benedict receives the effigy of Saint Eusebius.\n",
      "On that very night the boy is awoken by noises - one of the aunt's lovers, Giovanni, happens to be visiting. He runs to his aunt's room, and she hides the man in her closet. But the intruder's presence is soon revealed, and the aunt papers over his presence in her room by claiming that in fact Giovanni is St Eusebius. Benedict is told not to inform the priest of what happened, -to do so would only offend the \"celestial friends\" by what would be a sin of pride. The next morning, while he is affixing a picture of St Eusebius in her wardrobe to commemorate the occasion, he has a glimpse of his aunt, who returns from the bath, in a state of nakedness. She discovers him, and warns him not to say anything to the priest, even in the confession which will be the prelude to his first communion. This prohibition leads to him refraining from telling all of his 'sins' in confession to Father Quirino, and, ashamed by a sense that he has committed a sacrilege, during the first communion he feels that the host has stuck in his throat, and in a panic at incipient suffocation, runs away, only to slip from a wall and fall into a ravine  Despite local fears that he has come to a sorry end, he emerges unharmed, and the people proclaim that he has been the beneficiary of a miracle. The boy is dressed up like the saint, and carried in procession, as though he were a veritable icon. The aunt exploits the opportunity this concatenation of coincidences affords her, by ridding herself of this troublesome burden, by sending him to the Franciscan monastery, where he then grows up to maturity.\n",

One worker (McDowell with black hair and moustache) pockets a few beans (\"Coffee for the Breakfast Table\") but is seen by a foreman. He is next seen before a fat Caucasian magistrate who slobbers as he removes his cigar only to say \"Guilty.\" The foreman draws his machete and lays it across the unfortunate labourer's wrists, bound to a wooden block, revealing that he is to lose his hands for the theft of a few beans. The machete rises, falls, and we see McDowell draw back in a silent scream. The scene blacks out, the word NOW appears onscreen and expands quickly to fill it.\n",

Halim's son Kazim is engaged to Salim's daughter, Amina. Although he had publicly promised to stay in India for the sake of its Muslims, Halim later decides to quietly emigrate to Pakistan with his wife and son, believing that there was no future for Muslims in India. Salim resists the notion of moving, believing that peace and harmony would return soon, besides which, he has to care for their ageing mother, who refuses to leave the house of her forefathers. This puts Kazim and Amina's marriage plans on hold, although Kazim promises to return soon to marry her. Halim's stealthy migration affects Salim's standing in the community. In the aftermath of partition, the sudden migration of many Muslims from Agra left banks and other lenders deeply reluctant to lend money to Muslim businessmen like Salim Mirza, who had previously been held in high esteem, over fears that they would leave the country without repaying the loan. Unable to raise capital to finance production, Salim Mirza's business suffers.

Branwell is a painter and a self-portrait with his sisters is worthy of the general admiration of the family. He wants to pursue a professional career, but only goes as far as to establish a friendship with Leyland, a sculptor. Emily's favorite pastime is to walk across the bleak moors that surround the village dressed as a man. Anne, the youngest of the siblings, is her companion. Charlotte, more ambitious than the others, convinces their reluctant aunt to give her money to go to Belgium in order to study French. Her idea is to eventually come back and open a school. With their aunt's money and permission, Charlotte and Emily go to Brussels. Once there, Charlotte falls secretly in love with her teacher Monsieur Heger, who is already married. Emily plays the piano at school, but has a hard time there and is teased by her classmates for being English and Protestant in a Catholic country. Meanwhile, in England, Anne finds employment as a governess, taking over the education of the daughter of a wealthy family.\n",

Eugenia's behaviour at home and in public becomes increasingly erratic and when on top of this Lorenzo loses his post, the strain puts him into a mental hospital. Piera leaves school to work for a dressmaker and pursues her dream of acting, eventually breaking into television and theatre. Interleaved with her outside life we see her sexual development, from kissing neighbourhood boys to a lesbian relationship while she is in hospital with breathing problems and finally to adult men. While Piera is maturing as a woman and as an actress, Eugenia is deteriorating and has to be locked away. The film ends with Piera taking her mother out for the day to a deserted beach, where the two women undress and hug each other tightly in a moment of natural tenderness.\n",

He takes his wife to a café where they discuss their future. At the same café, Jacek is sitting at a table handling a length of rope and a stick which he keeps in his bag. The rope and stick appear to be a weapon. He puts away the rope and stick when he spots two girls playing at the other side of the window and he engages in a game with them.\n",

He discovers his wife has cheated on him and is not sure he wants to return to his former life and family. A friend, \"El-Negro\", who was killed during the military coup, appears in the night with a special mission: to help Floreal face what has happened when he was serving time in prison. El-Negro helps him to live through the important events that happened in his absence. El-Negro helps him get past his anger, understanding how hard it was to endure such a difficult time and how the military coup had crushed people's lives.

Edgar keeps flipping through the pages of an empty book, staring intently as if waiting for words to appear. He is unsure whether the project should be a novel, a play, an opera, or a film. In Paris, he interviews potential participants from all walks of life (including those people <a href=\"/wiki/Victor_Hugo\" title=\"Victor Hugo\">Victor Hugo</a> dubbed <a class=\"mw-redirect\" href=\"/wiki/Les_mis%C3%A9rables\" title=\"Les misérables\">les misérables</a>, whom Edgar considers important to the project), but is continually dissatisfied.

Berthe remembers Edgar (and marvels at his memory) but emphatically does not want to be involved in his project. She holds down several jobs and also cares for her three-year-old son. Edgar continues to interview people, to his continuing dissatisfaction. He is able to visualize the stages of youth and old age but keeps having trouble with adulthood.\n",

Two of the young rebels are now in the 40s and are completely detached from the hypocrisy of religion. One of them pretends to be very religious, to get back his job. The other, the protagonist, is uncertain, beset by moral doubts, mainly because of his young son who could learn the hypocrisy from him. \n",
      "The film is a journey through the absurd and surreal episodes. Ernesto, the protagonist, is contacted by a mysterious cardinal who wants to question him about the process of sanctification of the mother, about which he knew nothing until then. Then the child goes to school for the hearings with teachers, where he meets a young and charming, \"religious teacher\", to whom he is attracted, but that will be an impossibility. He has a discussion with a religious man appointed to investigate circumstances of \"martyrdom\", which asks account the non-baptism of his son, showing that he is well informed about him and trying to know why Ernest had \"lost faith\" . Ernesto is then challenged to a duel, for petty reasons, from a noble dream of an improbable restoration of the monarchy, but the duel is interrupted after a few seconds. He talks with his aunt, who has never shown much faith, but now, attracted by possible financial gain and popularity that the family would derive from sanctification, for a purely opportunistic attempt to bring her nephew on the \"right path\". Meanwhile, the wife of Ernesto administers a sort of baptism to the child sleeping, anxious to repair the previous \"no\".\n",

Her father, Étienne Cassard, is a respected novelist, but rarely considers the feelings of others, only thinking of himself and worrying about aging. Pierre Millet, a younger writer, doubts he will ever be successful. Meanwhile, Sylvia Millet, a singing teacher, believes in her husband's talent, but doubts her own and that of her student, Lolita. When Sylvia discovers that Lolita is the daughter of Étienne, an author whom she admires, she befriends Lolita in order to gain access to Étienne for her husband's sake. Lolita does not believe or see that Sylvia is just another person being generous to her because her father is famous. She begins to confide in Sylvia about her father, love life, and self-confidence issues. Sylvia surprisingly takes a liking to Lolita and begins to see Étienne for the man he really is. Throughout the film Sébastien, a young journalist, befriends Lolita. He is the only one with pure intents, even after he finds out who her father is. He takes a liking to Lolita, but she refuses to show any interests and is only infatuated with another boy, Mathieu. Mathieu is everything Sébastien is not. Mathieu only has interest for Lolita because of her father and mistreats her. Lolita casts all of these same behaviors on Sébastien and does not realize that he truly does like her for herself. After a crazy weekend at Étienne's cottage, Sylvia leaves Pierre because he has become just like Étienne, Lolita goes after Sébastien because she realizes he has honest intentions, and Étienne is repeatedly reminded that he is an indifferent father to Lolita.\n",

Unsure of his own emotional preparedness in rekindling the relationship, he decides to watch a play while waiting for her to complete her work shift, delaying the decision to meet her later in the evening. The final words of anguish in the play, uttered by a desperately ill child unable to be comforted by his mother, would later be echoed by Sangwon from the rooftop of his parents' apartment after his own failed act of despair. In the film's corollary chapter, Tongsu, a struggling, rootless, and inscrutable filmmaker who has become obsessed with a short film directed by his former classmate - and in particular, the devoted and obliging woman in the film - encounters the young actress in person and begins to ingratiate himself into her company, acting out his projected image of her by imitating gestures and revisiting locations from the film in an attempt to realize his own created image of her.\n",
