Rosa gets Maya a job as a janitor: a non-union janitorial service has the contract, the foul-mouthed supervisor can fire workers on a whim, and the service-workers' union has assigned organizer Sam Shapiro to bring its \"justice for janitors\" campaign to the building. Sam finds Maya a willing listener, she's also attracted to him. Rosa resists, she has an ailing husband to consider. The workers try for public support; management intimidates workers to divide and conquer. Rosa and Maya as well as workers and management may be set to collide.", "Language": "English, Spanish", "Country": "UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Switzerland", "Awards": "5 wins & 10 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjk1MDU1NjQtNGYyNS00NWU1LThlZDYtMTNkZDFkOWM1M2M5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTM0NTU5Mg@@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "57", "imdbRating": "7.1", "imdbVotes": "5,011", "imdbID": "tt0212826", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "27 Nov 2001", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Lions Gate Releasing", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.1/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "67%", "MetacriticRating": "57/100"}
