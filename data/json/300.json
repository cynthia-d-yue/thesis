But that changes when a family-owned multinational conglomerate Mirando Corporation takes Okja for themselves and transports her to New York, where image obsessed and self-promoting CEO Lucy Mirando (Tilda Swinton) has big plans for Mija's dearest friend. With no particular plan but single-minded in intent, Mija sets out on a rescue mission, but her already daunting journey quickly becomes more complicated when she crosses paths with disparate groups of capitalists, demonstrators and consumers, each battling to control the fate of Okja...while all Mija wants to do is bring her friend home. Deftly blending genres, humor, poignancy and drama, Bong Joon Ho (Snowpiercer, The Host) begins with the gentlest of premises-the bond between man and animal-and ultimately creates a distinct and layered vision of the world that addresses the animal inside us all. Okja is a Plan B Entertainment, Lewis Pictures and Kate Street Picture Company production in association with Netflix.", "Language": "English, Korean, Spanish", "Country": "South Korea, USA", "Awards": "7 wins & 20 nominations.", "Poster": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQxMTcxNDgxN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTczNTIzMjI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "Metascore": "75", "imdbRating": "7.3", "imdbVotes": "84,304", "imdbID": "tt3967856", "Type": "movie", "DVD": "28 Jun 2017", "BoxOffice": "N/A", "Production": "Netflix", "Website": "N/A", "Response": "True", "InternetMovieDatabaseRating": "7.3/10", "RottenTomatoesRating": "86%", "MetacriticRating": "75/100"}
